# Machine_Learning_with_Python_IBM
This course dives into the basics of machine learning using an approachable, and well-known programming language, Python.   In this course, we will be reviewing two main components: First, you will be learning about the purpose of Machine Learning and where it applies to the real world.  Second, you will get a general overview of Machine Learning topics such as supervised vs unsupervised learning,  model evaluation, and Machine Learning algorithms.   In this course, you practice with real-life examples of Machine learning and see how it affects society in ways you may not have guessed!
